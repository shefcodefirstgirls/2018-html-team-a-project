<p>Of the 10 million deaths every year in children less than five years of age over 99% are in developing countries and 70% are caused by infectious diseases. 2 million deaths are caused by measles, pertussis, or tetanus despite the fact that we have had effective vaccines against these diseases for many years. It is important to develop new vaccines but it is even more important to find ways to deliver vaccines to the poorest children, who need them most. The development of new vaccines requires scientific work in high-income countries but the provision of vaccines to children in developing, low-income countries depends on financial resources, policy decisions, and other non-scientific factors.</p>
