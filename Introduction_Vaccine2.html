    <h1>What is Vaccine?</h1>
    <p>Vaccines are substances that prepare the immune system to fight a disease-causing germ or other
pathogen by imitating an infection. They trick the immune system into making a “memory” of that
germ without ever having to fight the real germ in the first place. Now, when the immune system
encounters the real pathogen — whether it’s a virus, bacterium or other microbe — it is ready to
attack it. As a result, the vaccinated person doesn’t get sick.</p>
    <h1>Why we should have vaccine?</h1>
    <h4>There are three reasons why we immunise children.</h4>

       <p>1. immunisation prevents children from becoming ill with unpleasant and serious
infectious diseases, which have a risk of complications and long-term side effects.</p>
<p>2. we immunise to try and help protect all children in the population. The more people
who are immunised, the less of the infectious disease there is around so the less
chance there is of anyone catching it.</p>
<p>3. we immunise to try and wipe out as many infectious diseases as we can everywhere
in the world. Although improvements in living standards and cleaner water have been
key factors in the decline of infectious diseases in the United Kingdom and elsewhere
in the world, it is quite clear that the immunisation programmes have made a
significant impact in getting rid of infectious diseases as well.  In the ten years before
the measles vaccine was introduced in to the United Kingdom, there were around
380,000 cases a year of measles and 850 deaths (Bedford, Elliman, 2001). Measles,
mumps and rubella vaccine was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1988. In the ten
years since then - between 1989 and 1998, there were four deaths associated with
acute measles and 19 deaths resulting from complications from measles.</p>

<h1>The story of vaccine</h1>
<h2><img src="images/21.png"></h2>
<p>Jenner was the first doctor to vaccinate people against smallpox. Smallpox was a dangerous disease. Jenner found a way to prevent people catching smallpox so fewer people got ill, and the disease became rare. In 1796, he carried out his now famous experiment on eight-year-old James Phipps. Jenner inserted pus taken from a cowpox pustule and inserted it into an incision on the boy's arm. He was testing his theory, drawn from the folklore of the countryside, that milkmaids who suffered the mild disease of cowpox never contracted smallpox, one of the greatest killers of the period, particularly among children. Jenner subsequently proved that having been inoculated with cowpox Phipps was immune to smallpox. </p>
